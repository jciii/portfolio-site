      I am a truck driver with over ten years of experience and excellence. I am changing fields to
      excel myself and have more for my family. I am highly motivated and an eager to learn individual. In my
      current field
      I
      have
      learned great communication skills and teamwork to help accomplish the task at hand. I am excited to have
      the
      opportunity to meet and work with you.
